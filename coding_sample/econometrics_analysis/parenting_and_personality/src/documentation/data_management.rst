Documentation of the code in *src.data_management*.

We mainly merge all the clean data and measure here.
We merge the data set according to the personal id in the SOEP questionnaire.
There are around 6000 Samples left after merging all the available data together.

Also, we separate the merge sample into male and female.  we split our sample into male and female adolescents in order to investigate potential differences in sexes and special mother-daughter or father-son relations. Finally we extend our analysis to the children sample of age ten and eleven to find out whether the effects of parental involvement are already present at an early stage in childhood.
