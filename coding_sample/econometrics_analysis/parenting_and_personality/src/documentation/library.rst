In this project, as the creation of measure of personality and parenting style, also the control variable, required a lot of data cleaning, data reforming process, so we put most of the cleaning process in here.

For the creation of the Big Five measure:

The Big Five personality traits are measured by a 15-item questionnaire with each trait covered by three items. The respondents need to determine the extent to which they agreed on certain statements related to their character. The items have to be answered on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (“Does Not Apply at All”) to 7 (“Applies Completely”). For example, the item “Considerate, friendly” is referring to the trait agreeableness and “Often worry” is referring to the trait neuroticism. For some items, we inverted the score due to the inverted statement. As a result, we can obtain a score of the specific traits of a respondent by averaging the item scores referring to their corresponding trait. The scores are standardized by subtracting mean of variables and divided by its standard deviation. 

For the creation of the LoC:

Locus of control is measured by a 10-item questionnaire including 5 items for external and 5 items for internal locus of control. Similar to above, the respondents are required to determine the extent to which they agree on certain statements related to their character based on a 4-point scale ranging from 1 (“disagree completely”) to 4 (“agree completely”). We create the locus of control score of an individual, following the approach from Pinger et al. (2010). We conduct a principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction. Note that in order to create the index from proxies measuring internal and external locus we invert the values of some of the 10 proxies.

For the creation of the parenting involvement measure:

For the creation of the parental involvement score we follow the approach by Zumbuehl et al. (2018). The SOEP includes specific items regarding parental involvement in the Youth Questionnaire. It consists of five items which were measured combined for both parents and relate to school performance and engagement. Additionally, the involvement score takes sixteen proxies of mother’s and father’s intensity of involvement in the respondents’ life, eight relating to the mother and eight relating to the father, into account. The adolescents for example had to state to which extent statements as “Parents take part in parents-evening” or “Mother talks about things that worry you” apply. All the items are measured either as binary variables or on a 4- or 5-point scale. Also, the variables are standardized by the method stated above. We assume parents can choose to participate in their children life if they want such that parental involvement is a kind of general parental investment. By applying the principal component analysis on the parental involvement variables, we constructed two involvement scores, one for the mothers of each adolescent and one for the fathers, respectively. T The factor loadings we obtained are similar to those by Zumbuehl et al. (2018).
