This empirical analysis uses data of the 33rd wave of the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), a representative panel study of households in Germany conducted annualy since 1984. The SOEP collects socio-economic information on all members of over 12.000 households. The questionnaires given to the adult members of the sampled households cover a wide range of topics from biography over family life to personality, preferences and happiness. Since the year 2000, every child in the household turning 18 the following year enters the survey filling out the Youth Questionnaire. This questionnaire gathers information regarding childhood, schooling and the relation to the parents. 

To analyse the effects of parental involvement on children's personality traits, we use the data available in the Youth Questionnaire which provides information on  parental involvement in the childâ€™s life and the personality of the children. We have a starting sample of around 3900 individuals who filled the questionnaire at the age of 17 and provided information on their personality and parental involvement.
